# Space Invaders - My SDL2 Challenge

## Overview

I took on the challenge to create my own version of the classic Space Invaders game from scratch using SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 2). This project is an exciting opportunity to test and enhance my skills in game development, C++ programming, and utilizing SDL2 for multimedia applications.

* Custom Graphics: All sprites and graphics were designed and integrated manually.
* Smooth Controls: Player movement and shooting are responsive, ensuring smooth gameplay.

## Tools and Technologies

* Language: C++
* Framework: SDL2

## TODO
* Alien Waves: Multiple levels of increasingly challenging alien waves.
* Score System: Tracks the player's score based on destroyed aliens.
* Sound Effects: Integrated sound effects for shooting, alien destruction, and game events.
